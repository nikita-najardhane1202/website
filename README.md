A minimal, focused daily-blog site built with semantic HTML and clean, responsive CSS.

Contents

1. Open `index.html` in your browser, or use a development server like Live Server in VS Code.

Purpose & design

- Minimal and readable: prioritized typography, spacing, and clear hierarchy.
- Responsive layout: two columns on desktop, single column on small screens.
- Semantic and accessible: uses `article`, `aside`, `header`, `nav`, and `time` elements.

Suggested next steps

- Replace the sample posts in `index.html` with actual daily entries or integrate a static-site generator.
- Connect the subscribe form to an email provider or backend endpoint.
- Add social sharing, tags archive, or pagination as needed.
